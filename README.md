Collected here is code inspired by Brendan Gregg's _BPF Performance Tools_ (http://www.brendangregg.com/bpf-performance-tools-book.html).  The repo is initially populated by patches extracted from my earlier Cpp-Exercises repository (https://github.com/chaiken/Cpp-exercises).

The goal of writing the programs included here is to learn more about BPF and related programs by treating the book as a tutorial with exercises inspired by each chapter.
